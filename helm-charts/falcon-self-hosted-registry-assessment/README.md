# CrowdStrike Self-hosted Registry Assessment (SHRA) Helm Chart 

[Falcon](https://www.crowdstrike.com/) is the [CrowdStrike](https://www.crowdstrike.com/)
platform purpose-built to stop breaches via a unified set of cloud-delivered
technologies.

This Helm Chart helps you deploy CrowdStrike's Self-hosted Registry Assessment tool (SHRA) to create inventories of the container images in your registries. The software sends the inventories to the CrowdStrike cloud where they are analyzed for vulnerabilities and reported in your Falcon console. With SHRA, your images stay in your environment. This approach is an alternative to CrowdStrike's cloud-based [Cloud Workload Protection](https://www.crowdstrike.com/platform/cloud-security/cwpp/) registry assessment options, where images are copied into the CrowdStrike registry to create the image inventories. 

Choosing to use the self-hosted approach vs CrowdStrike's cloud-based Cloud Workload Protection solution has a cost implication.
For example, running these services in your environment requires additional storage and computing time.
These costs may or may not be offset by the savings for data egress costs incurred with the cloud-based Cloud Workload Protection solution.

## How it works

The following architecture diagram gives you insight into how SHRA works. 

* Following our [configuration instructions](#customize-your-deployment), you create a `values_override.yaml` file specific to your environment, including:
  * Your CrowdStrike identification and credentials.
  * The container registry where you have placed the two SHRA images.
  * The container registries you want SHRA to scan for new images, and how often to scan them.
  * How SHRA should configure its persistent and temporary storage.
  
* You run the Helm install command. As the Helm Chart deploys SHRA:
  * The jobs database and registry assessment cache are initialized in persistent storage.
  * The **Jobs Controller** Pod spins up.
  * One or more **Executor** Pods spin up.

* Per your configured schedule, the Jobs Controller tells one or more Executors which registries to scan. The Executors break up the work as follows:
   * `Registry scan`: identifies the repositories within your configured registries
   * `Repository scan`: identifies image tags within the repositories
   * `Tag assessment`: downloads, uncompresses, and inventories new images, then sends the inventories to CrowdStrike's cloud for analysis

* The CrowdStrike cloud assesses the image inventories to determine their potential vulnerabilities. Results are visible in the Falcon console. 
  * Go to [**Cloud security > Vulnerabilities > Image assessments**](https://falcon.crowdstrike.com/cloud-security/cwpp/image-assessment/images), then click the **Images** tab. 
Images scanned by SHRA have **Self-hosted registry** in the optional **Sources** column.

![High level diagram showing the architecture and deployment for the Falcon Self-hosted Registry Assessment tool (SHRA). It depicts a user installing SHRA via the Helm Chart files and a values_override.yaml file. SHRA's two images, the Jobs Controller and Executor, and three related persistent volume claims are created inside the namespace falcon-self-hosted-registry-assessment. Arrows depict the flow of new image inventories from the Executor's tag assessment component to the CrowdStrike cloud, where analysis results are visible to the user via the Falcon console.](self-hosted-registry-assessment-flow.jpg "Self-hosted Registry Assessment")

> [!TIP]  
> Performance of the `Registry scan` and `Repository scan` jobs are networking bound, for the most part. 
> By contrast, the `Tag assessment` job is mainly constrained by the amount of available disk space to unpack the images and perform the inventory. 
> Ensure you provide sufficient disk space. For more information, see Configure temporary storage.

### How SHRA determines if an image is new

To streamline work, the Executor's `Tag assessment` process uses a local registry assessment database to keep track of image tags previously scanned. 
If an image tag is not found in the local database, it asks the CrowdStrike cloud if the image is new. 
Only images that have not been inventoried before are unpacked and inventoried.

## Kubernetes cluster compatibility

The Falcon Self-hosted Registry Scanner Helm Chart has been tested to deploy on the following Kubernetes distributions:

* Amazon Elastic Kubernetes Service (EKS) - EKS and EKS Fargate
* Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS)
* Google Kubernetes Engine (GKE)
* SUSE Rancher K3s
* Red Hat OpenShift Kubernetes

## Requirements

* Access to the Falcon console with one or more of these default roles:
  * Falcon Administrator
  * Cloud Security Manager
  * Kubernetes and Containers Manager
* A client API key, as described in the configuration steps.
* A x86_64 (AMD64) Kubernetes cluster.
* [Helm](https://helm.sh/) 3.x is installed and supported by the Kubernetes provider.
* A 1+ GiB persistent volume for a job controller SQLite database. 
* A 1+ GiB persistent volume used by the executor for a registry assessment cache.
* A working volume to store and expand images for assessment.
* Networking sufficient to communicate with CrowdStrike cloud services and your image registries.
* Optional. [Cert Manager - Helm](https://cert-manager.io/docs/installation/helm/) if you wish to use TLS between the containers in this Chart. See [TLS Configuration](#optional-configure-grpc-over-tls).

> [!NOTE]  
> For more information on SHRA's persistent and temporary storage needs, see [Configure persistent data storage](#configure-persistent-data-storage) and [Configure temporary storage](#configure-temporary-storage).

## Create a basic config file

Before you install this Helm Chart, there are several config values to customize for your specific use case.

To start, copy the following code block into a new file called `values_override.yaml`.
Follow the steps in [Customize your deployment](#customize-your-deployment) to configure these values.

> [!TIP]  
> If you have experience deploying other CrowdStrike Helm Charts, you can refer to [Falcon Chart configuration options](#falcon-chart-configuration-options) for details on how to customize the fields in this minimal installation example. 

```yaml
crowdstrikeConfig:
  clientID: ""
  clientSecret: ""
  
executor:
  image:
    registry: ""
    repository: ""
    tag: ""

  dbStorage:
    storageClass: ""

  assessmentStorage:
    type: "PVC"
    pvc:
      storageClass: ""

jobController:
  image:
    registry: ""
    repository: ""
    tag: ""

  dbStorage:
    storageClass: ""

registryConfigs:
  - type: dockerhub
    credentials:
      username: ""
      password: ""
    allowedRepositories: ""
    port: "443"
    host: "https://registry-1.docker.io"
    cronSchedule: "* * * * *"
  - type: dockerhub
    credentials:
      username: ""
      password: ""
    allowedRepositories: ""
    port: "443"
    host: "https://registry-2.docker.io"
    cronSchedule: "0 0 * * *"
```

Continue to tailor this file for your environment by following the remaining steps in this guide.

## Customize your deployment

Configure your deployment of the Self-hosted Registry Assessment tool by preparing a namespace for SHRA and adding your configuration details to your `values_override.yaml` file.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Deployment of SHRA deployment with Helm isnâ€™t complicated, but there are several detailed steps and some must happen in sequence. 
> We strongly recommend that you follow these steps, in order, from top to bottom.

The most commonly used parameters are described in the steps below. 
For other options, refer to the [full set of configurations options](#falcon-chart-configuration-options) and the comments in provided `values.yaml`.

### Create the SHRA namespace

Create a namespace to use for deploying SHRA, storing Kubernetes secrets, and hosting optional utilities throughout the installation process.

We recommend the namespace `falcon-self-hosted-registry-assessment`, and we use that namespace throughout these instructions.

1. Create the namespace:
   ``` sh
   kubectl create namespace falcon-self-hosted-registry-assessment
   ```
1. As needed to meet your security requirements, create Kubernetes Roles and/or RoleBindings for this namespace and apply them. 
   The SHRA Pods don't interact with the Kubernetes APIs and don't need any specific Kubernetes permissions, so only default access is needed.
   For more information, see [Kubernetes documentation on RBAC authorization](https://kubernetes.io/docs/reference/access-authn-authz/rbac/).

### Configure your CrowdStrike credentials 

To download and operate CrowdStrike's self-hosted registry assessment tool, you need a CrowdStrike API client ID and secret with the required API scopes.

Create your client ID and secret: 
1. In the Falcon console, go to [**Support and resources** > **Resources and tools** > **API clients and keys**](https://falcon.crowdstrike.com/api-clients-and-keys/).
1. Click **Add new API client**.
1. In the **Add new API client** dialog, enter a client name and description that identify this key is for self-hosted registry assessment.
1. Set the following API scopes
   * **Falcon Container CLI**: Write
   * **Falcon Container Image**: Read/Write
   * **Falcon Images Download**: Read
   * **Sensor Download**: Read  
1. Click **Add**.
1. From the **API client created** dialog, copy the **client ID** and **secret** to a password management or secret management service. 

> [!NOTE]  
> The API client secret will not be presented again, so don't close the dialog until you have this value safely saved. 

Export these variables for use in later steps:
```sh
export FALCON_CLIENT_ID=<your-falcon-api-client-id>
export FALCON_CLIENT_SECRET=<your-falcon-api-client-secret>
```

There are two options for setting your CrowdStrike client ID and secret for SHRA:
* explicitly in helm
* via Kubernetes secrets or configmaps

#### Option 1. Configure your CrowdStrike credentials in values_override.yaml

In your `values_override.yaml` file, set `crowdstrikeConfig.clientID` and `crowdstrikeConfig.clientSecret` to the values you saved in `FALCON_CLIENT_ID` and `FALCON_CLIENT_SECRET`.

For example, 
```yaml
crowdstrikeConfig:
  clientID: "aabbccddee112233445566aabbccddee"
  clientSecret: "aabbccddee112233445566aabbccddee11223344"
```

| Parameter                           |           | Description                                                                                           | Default   |
|:------------------------------------|-----------|:------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|:----------|
| `crowdstrikeConfig.clientID`        | required  | The client ID used to authenticate the self-hosted registry assessment service with CrowdStrike.      | ""        |
| `crowdstrikeConfig.clientSecret`    | required  | The client secret used to authenticate the self-hosted registry assessment service with CrowdStrike.  | ""        |
| `crowdstrikeConfig.clientSecretRef` | optional  | Refernce to a secret which contains `clientID` (`CLIENT_ID`) and `clientSecret` (`CLIENT_SECRET`).  | ""


#### Option 2. Configure your CrowdStrike credentials using Kubernetes secrets or configmaps

You can use existing Kubernetes secrets or configmaps to provide your CrowdStrike credential environment variables to the SHRA pods. This is useful when you want to manage credential settings separately from the Helm chart deployment.

Your Kubernetes secret must be in the `falcon-self-hosted-registry-assessment` and must have the following 2 keys:
- CLIENT_ID 
- CLIENT_SECRET

You may already have a secret or configmap you want to use. If not, create one.

For example, to create a Kubernetes secret:

```sh
kubectl create secret generic crowdstrike-credentials \
   --namespace falcon-self-hosted-registry-assessment \
   --from-literal=CLIENT_ID="aabbccddee112233445566aabbccddee" \
   --from-literal=CLIENT_SECRET="aabbccddee112233445566aabbccddee11223344"
```

To use a Kubernetes secret for your credentials, add the following reference to the `executor` section of your `values_override.yaml` file. Update `name` to match the name of your secret.

   ```yaml
   executor:
     additionalSecretEnvFrom:
       - name: "crowdstrike-credentials"
         optional: false
   ```

To use a Kubernetes configmap for your credentials, add the following references to the `executor` section of your `values_override.yaml` file. Update `name` to match the name of your configmap.

   ```yaml
   executor:
     additionalCMEnvFrom:
       - name: "crowdstrike-credentials"
         optional: false
   ```

In both cases, ensure the value in the `name` field matches your secret name or configmap name. 

Use the `optional` field to specify whether the pods should start if the secret is missing:
- **`optional: false`** (default) - Pods will fail to start if the secret doesn't exist
- **`optional: true`** - Pods will start even if the secret is missing

After completing the remaining steps to configure and install SHRA, return here to verify that the environment variables are properly configured in the pod's environment:

```sh
kubectl exec -n falcon-self-hosted-registry-assessment <pod-name> -- env | grep -i client
```

### Copy the SHRA images to your registry

To strengthen your container supply chain security and maintain security best practices, we recommend you deploy the SHRA containers from your private registry.

The two OCI images you need are:
- `falcon-jobcontroller`: The job controller manages scheduling and coordination.
- `falcon-registryassessmentexecutor`: The executor finds and inventories new images to scan. 

There are a few ways to get the available image tags, including the [Falcon sensor pull script](https://github.com/CrowdStrike/falcon-scripts/tree/main/bash/containers/falcon-container-sensor-pull) and tools like [skopeo](https://github.com/containers/skopeo). 
These instructions use the Falcon sensor pull script.

**What you'll do**:
- Download the Falcon sensor pull script
- List available images
- Copy your selected SHRA container image versions to your private registry
- Add your registry URL and authentication info to your `values_override.yaml` file.

The following steps guide you through the image copy process.

#### Download the Falcon sensor pull script

Get the latest version of our Falcon sensor pull script from our [GitHub repo](https://github.com/CrowdStrike/falcon-scripts/tree/main/bash/containers/falcon-container-sensor-pull).

1. Download the Falcon sensor pull script:
   ```
   curl -sSL -o falcon-container-sensor-pull.sh "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/CrowdStrike/falcon-scripts/main/bash/containers/falcon-container-sensor-pull/falcon-container-sensor-pull.sh"
   ```
1. Make the local script executable:
   ```
   chmod u+x ./falcon-container-sensor-pull.sh
   ```

#### List available images

These steps use the environment variables `FALCON_CLIENT_ID` and `FALCON_CLIENT_SECRET` set in earlier steps. 
If you're in a new terminal window or if running the commands below causes authentication errors, repeat the variable exports described in [Configure your CrowdStrike credentials](#configure-your-crowdstrike-credentials).

1. Use the pull script to fetch the image tags for the SHRA job controller image to see available tag versions:
   ```
   ./falcon-container-sensor-pull.sh \
     --client-id ${FALCON_CLIENT_ID} \
     --client-secret ${FALCON_CLIENT_SECRET} \
     --list-tags \
     --type falcon-jobcontroller
   ```
   You can expect output similar to this:
   ```
   {
   "name": "falcon-jobcontroller",
   "repository": "registry.crowdstrike.com/falcon-selfhostedregistryassessment/release/falcon-jobcontroller",
   "tags": [
      "1.0.0",
      "1.0.1"
   ]
   }
   ```

1. Repeat the process for the executor image:
   ```
   ./falcon-container-sensor-pull.sh \
   --client-id ${FALCON_CLIENT_ID} \
   --client-secret ${FALCON_CLIENT_SECRET} \
   --list-tags \
   --type falcon-registryassessmentexecutor
   ```
   You can expect output similar to this:
   ```
   {
   "name": "falcon-registryassessmentexecutor",
   "repository": "registry.crowdstrike.com/falcon-selfhostedregistryassessment/release/falcon-registryassessmentexecutor",
   "tags": [
      "1.0.0",
      "1.0.1",
      "1.0.2"
   ]
   }
   ```

1. Make a note of the latest image tag for both the executor and job-controller images. 
   For example, in the sample output, the latest tags are `1.0.1` for falcon-jobcontroller and `1.0.2` for falcon-registryassessmentexecutor.

> [!TIP]
> For stronger matching, we recommend using digests instead of tags to identify images. 
> Use a tool like [skopeo](https://github.com/containers/skopeo) to discover available SHRA image digests.
> If needed, use the Falcon sensor pull scriptâ€™s `--dump-credentials` option to retrieve your CrowdStrike registry credentials.

#### Copy the SHRA images to your registry

Copy the SHRA's `falcon-jobcontroller` and `falcon-registryassessmentexecutor` images from the CrowdStrike registry and store them in your private registry.

> [!NOTE]  
> These steps assume that:
>   * you're authenticated to your target registry and have authorization to push new images
>   * following our directions, you have set the required environment variables 

1. Create new environment variables for your chosen versions of the two SHRA images. 
   Replace `1.0.0` with the image tag you want to fetch.
   ```sh
   export FALCON_SHRA_JC_VERSION="1.0.0"
   export FALCON_SHRA_EX_VERSION="1.0.0"
   ```

1. Set an environment variable with the URL for your private registry, where you'll store these images. 
   We recommend using `falcon-selfhostedregistryassessment` in your repository name. 
   Adjust this sample with your registry's URL and to match your repository naming scheme. 
   ```sh
   export MY_SHRA_REPO=<your-registry-url>/falcon-selfhostedregistryassessment
   ```

1. Use the Falcon sensor pull script to copy the SHRA job controller image to your registry:
   ```
   ./falcon-container-sensor-pull.sh \
   --client-id ${FALCON_CLIENT_ID} \
   --client-secret ${FALCON_CLIENT_SECRET} \
   --copy ${MY_SHRA_REPO}/falcon-jobcontroller \
   --type falcon-jobcontroller \
   --version ${FALCON_SHRA_JC_VERSION}
   ```

1. Repeat the process for the executor image:
   ```
   ./falcon-container-sensor-pull.sh \
   --client-id ${FALCON_CLIENT_ID} \
   --client-secret ${FALCON_CLIENT_SECRET} \
   --copy ${MY_SHRA_REPO}/falcon-registryassessmentexecutor \
   --type falcon-registryassessmentexecutor \
   --version ${FALCON_SHRA_EX_VERSION}
   ```

1. Optional. Verify the copy was successful. Use `skopeo list`, `docker pull`, or `docker images` commands to verify that the SHRA images are accessible now from your registry.

Follow the next step to prepare your registry credentials. Then, add your registry url, repository paths, image versions, and credentials to `values_override.yaml` file. 
For more info, see [Add registry and image details to the configuration](#add-registry-and-image-details-to-the-configuration).

#### Prepare credentials for your registry

The Helm Chart installation process requires authentication to your registry to download the SHRA images for deployment.

You have two options for providing registry credentials:

* **Option 1:** Use the following command to get a base64 encoded version of your Docker authentication string (modify as needed if your credentials are not located at ~/.docker/config.json):
   ``` sh
   cat ~/.docker/config.json | base64
   ```
   In the next step, use the resulting value to configure `executor.image.registryConfigJSON` and `jobController.image.registryConfigJSON`.

* **Option 2:** Create a Kubernetes imagePullSecret with your credentials in the `falcon-self-hosted-registry-assessment` namespace. 
   Follow the Kubernetes instructions to [create your imagePullSecret](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/containers/images/#specifying-imagepullsecrets-on-a-pod).
   In the next step, use your pullSecret's name to configure `executor.image.pullSecret` and `jobController.image.pullSecret`.

#### Add registry and image details to the configuration

Now that you've gathered the necessary information, verify and adjust image registry location, version tags, and authentication data in your `values_override.yaml` file. 

For example, using a pullSecret for authentication to the registry:
```yaml
executor:
  image:
    registry: "myregistry.example.com/falcon-selfhostedregistryassessment"
    repository: "falcon-registryassessmentexecutor"
    tag: "1.0.0"
    pullSecret: "my-reg-credentials"

jobController:
  image:
    registry: "myregistry.example.com/falcon-selfhostedregistryassessment"
    repository: "falcon-jobcontroller"
    tag: "1.0.0"
    pullSecret: "my-reg-credentials"
```

### Configure which registries to scan

The Self-hosted Registry Assessment tool watches one or more registries.
When multiple registries are configured, jobs are scheduled round robin to balance between them.

Find your registry type(s) in the sections below for configuration instructions, including authentication requirements and any additional required fields. 

* [Amazon Elastic Container Registry (AWS ECR)](#amazon-elastic-container-registry-aws-ecr)
* [Azure Container Registry](#azure-container-registry)
* [Docker Hub](#docker-hub)
* [Docker Registry V2](#docker-registry-v2)
* [GitLab](#gitlab)
* [Github](#github)
* [Google Artifact Registry](#google-artifact-registry-gar)
* [Google Container Registry](#google-container-registry-gcr)
* [Harbor](#harbor)
* [IBM Cloud Registry](#ibm-cloud-registry)
* [JFrog Artifactory](#jfrog-artifactory)
* [Mirantis Secure Registry (MCR)](#mirantis-secure-registry-mcr)
* [Oracle Container Registry](#oracle-container-registry)
* [Red Hat Openshift](#red-hat-openshift)
* [Red Hat Quay.io](#red-hat-quayio)
* [Sonatype Nexus](#sonatype-nexus)

For each registry you want to add, create an entry in the `registryConfigs` array in your `values_override.yaml` file.
Be sure to specify the correct `type` field for your registry so SHRA knows how to connect to it. 

> [!TIP]
> For registry types with username and password authentication, we recommend Kubernetes secrets instead of plaintext passwords.
> We support two [Kubernetes secret types](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/configuration/secret/#secret-types): [`dockercfg`](https://kubernetes.io/docs/reference/kubectl/generated/kubectl_create/kubectl_create_secret_docker-registry/) and [`dockerconfigjson`](https://kubernetes.io/docs/tasks/configure-pod-container/pull-image-private-registry).
> 1. Create your named secrets in the `falcon-self-hosted-registry-assessment` namespace.
> 1. In your `values_override.yaml` file, replace the `username` and `password` parameters with `kubernetesSecretName` and `kubernetesSecretNamespace` (both are required).

#### Amazon Elastic Container Registry (AWS ECR)

Copy this registry configuration to your `values_override.yaml` file and provide the required information.

Notes:
* To access ECR, the host needs either direct access or the ability to assume an IAM role with appropriate permissions for the ECR registry.
* If role assumption is needed to retrieve ECR tokens, supply both `credentials.aws_iam_role` and `credentials.aws_external_id`. 
  Ensure the roles have a trust-relationship configured to allow the service account access to the resources in the SHRA namespace (the default namespace used in these setup instructions is `falcon-self-hosted-registry-assessment`).
  For additional information on IAM Roles, refer to the [AWS documentation](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/id_roles_create_for-user.html).

```yaml
 - type: ecr
   credentials:
    aws_iam_role: ""
    aws_external_id: ""
   allowedRepositories: ""
   port: "443"
   host: ""
   cronSchedule: "0 0 * * *"
```

```
Continue to add additional registries, or proceed to [Validate your registry credentials locally](#validate-the-credentials-locally).

#### Validate the credentials locally

The docker API spec notably lacks details on authentication; as such each registry implements authentication and access controls slightly differently. 
It is highly recommended that you test the credentials you plan to use with SHRA. 
Use the command line to validate that your credentials have the appropriate authorization to scan registries, list tags, and pull images. 

```sh
DOCKER_USERNAME=<your docker username for login>
DOCKER_PASSWORD=<your docker password for login>
REGISTRY=<your registry host>
```

Validate that you can login. The following command should return **Login Succeeded**
```sh
echo $DOCKER_PASSWORD | docker login -u $DOCKER_USERNAME $REGISTRY --password-stdin
```

Validate that you can list tags for a known repository. The following command should list the tags for a given repository.
```sh
REPOSITORY=<known repository name within the registry>
skopeo list-tags --creds $DOCKER_USERNAME:$DOCKER_PASSWORD docker://$REGISTRY/$REPOSITORY
```

Validate that you can pull one of the tags within the repository. The following command should pull the image down to your local machine.
```sh
TAG=<known tag from the above skopeo list-tags command>
docker pull $REGISTRY/$REPOSITORY:$TAG
```

If any of these validation tests returns an unexpected result, double-check your credentials and verify that you have the correct authorization. 
If you're not able to authenticate to the registry and pull images with these credentials, neither can SHRA.

#### Apply your changes to the configuration file

Now that you've gathered the necessary information for your private registries, verify and adjust the following parameters in your `values_override.yaml` file.

| Parameter                                                 |                                                      | Description                                                                                                             | Default |

### Configure your scanning schedules

You configure how often you want SHRA to scan each of your configured registries. 
Specify your schedule as a unix-cron string in the `registryConfigs.*.cronSchedule` parameter for each registryConfigs section of your `values_override.yaml` file.

For example, if you have two dockerhub registries, the first with a weekly scan schedule and the second with a daily scan schedule:

```yaml 
registryConfigs:
  - type: dockerhub
    credentials:
      username: "myuser"
      password: "xxxyyyzzz"
    allowedRepositories: ""
    port: "5000"
    host: "https://registry-1.docker.io"
    cronSchedule: "0 0 * * 6"
  - type: dockerhub
    credentials:
      username: "anotheruser"
      password: "qqqrrrsss"
    allowedRepositories: ""
    port: "5000"
    host: "https://registry-2.docker.io"
    cronSchedule: "0 0 * * *"
```

A unix-cron schedule is defined with the string format "* * * * *". 
This set of 5 fields indicate when a job should be executed. A quick overview of the fields is:

```
|--------------------------- Minute (0-59)
|    |---------------------- Hour (0-23)
|    |    |----------------- Day of the month (1-31)
|    |    |    |------------ Month (1-12)
|    |    |    |    |------- Day of the week (0-6 where 0 is Monday; or MON-SUN)
|    |    |    |    |
|    |    |    |    |
*    *    *    *    *
```

In addition to the definitions above, unix-cron schedules permit various modifiers including:
* Match all possible values for a field with an asterisk (*)
* Specify ranges with a dash (-)
* Specify steps with a forward slash (/) 

Here are some common examples:
| `registryConfigs.*.cronSchedule` setting | Scanning schedule                             |
|:-----------------------------------------|:----------------------------------------------|

### Optional. Configure which repositories to scan

By default, SHRA scans all repositories in your configured registries. 
However, you can tailor SHRA with a repository allowlist to limit scanning to specific repositories within a registry.
This reduces the overall scan load and limits the results to the repositories that are important to you.

To create a list of allowed repositories within a registry, add a comma-separated list of repository names to the `registryConfigs.*.allowedRepositories` parameter. 
This restricts SHRA to scan only the repositories you specify, rather than scanning all repositories in the registry.

For example, your configuration might look like this:

```yaml
registryConfigs:
  - type: dockerhub
    credentials:
      username: "myuser"
      password: "xxxyyyzzz"
    allowedRepositories: "myapp,my/other/app,mytestrepo"
    port: "5000"
    host: "https://registry-1.docker.io"
    cronSchedule: "0 0 * * *"
```

In this example, SHRA onlys scans the myapp, my/other/app, and mytestrepo repositories in the specified dockerhub registry.
All other repositories in this registry are excluded from the scans.

> [!NOTE]  
> The `allowedRepositories` parameter doesn't support wildcard characters or regex matches.
> You must provide a comma-separated list of the specific repository names you want to include.

> [!TIP]
> If SHRA is already deployed when you change your `allowedRepositories` list, or make any other change to your `values_override.yaml` file, redeploy the Helm Chart. 
> For more info, see [Update SHRA](#update-shra).

### Configure persistent data storage

SHRA needs 2 persistent volume claims (PVC) for SQLite databases that allow the service to be resilient to down time and upgrades. 

The executor and job controller databases created in the PVCs start small and grow with usage, accumulating job and image information respectively.
We recommend a **minimum of 1 gibibyte of storage** for each database. This size accommodates approximately 2 million image scans. 

If you have multiple registries, or wish to scan registries faster, we recommend you increase the executor database volume size.
You can also adjust job controller retention periods to reduce the footprint of the jobs database.
See [Change persistent storage retention](#change-persistent-storage-retention) for details.

You have 2 options for SHRA's persistent data storage:
* New persistent volume claims are created
* You provide existing storage claim names

> [!IMPORTANT]  
> At deployment, SHRA tries to create the required storage claims. 
> However, since each Kubernetes installation uses different storage classes, SHRA cannot offer default storage classes that work universally. 
> **Your deployment will fail unless you configure the storage class type or specify names to existing storage claims.** 

To configure existing storage claim names, set `executor.dbStorage.storageClass` and/or `jobController.dbStorage.storageClass` to `false` and configure the matching `*dbStorage.existingClaimName` with your storage class name.
See an example in the snippet below.

To instead have new persistent volume claims created, configure executor and job controller storage class types that match your Kubernetes runtime and installation.
The following table lists storage class options for SHRA's supported runtimes.
Use these values to configure `executor.dbStorage.storageClass` and `jobController.dbStorage.storageClass` in your `values_override.yaml` file.

The following snippet shows how to use an existing storage claim for `executor.dbStorage` while allowing the container to create its own storage for `jobController.dbStorage`.

```yaml
executor:
  dbStorage:
    create: false
    existingClaimName: falcon-executor-db
    accessModes:

#### Storage driver considerations when sharing a PVC for the Executor Database

The primary focus of the Executor Database is to act as a local cache.
This ensures that SHRA is aware of what it has already scanned and speeds up future assessments. 
If you are running multiple executor pods, and your storageClass supports it, the executor pods can share a single database. 
With a single database, all pods are aware of the work performed by the other pods.  

By default, the `executor.dbStorage.accessModes` field is set to `ReadWriteOnce`, as this mode is supported by all storage drivers. However, this setting prohibits sharing of a single database volume across pods. 

To share an executor database across your executor pods:

1. Confirm that your storageClass supports the `ReadWriteMany` mode.
2. Set  `executor.dbStorage.accessModes` to `ReadWriteMany`. 

#### Change persistent storage retention

To reduce the footprint of the `job controller` database, you can adjust data retention periods for each of the three main jobs it schedules for `executor`.

Retention for each of the three job types is 604800 seconds (7 days) unless you specify a different value when deploying the Helm Chart.
Be aware that a longer retention period may be helpful to facilitate debugging any potential registry assessment issues.

To change the default data retention for these job types, add or replace the following values in your `values_override.yaml` file.

| Parameter                                                               |         | Description                                                                           | Default   |
|:------------------------------------------------------------------------|:--------|:--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|:----------|
| `crowdstrikeConfig.jobTypeConfigs.registryCollection.jobRetentionMax`   |         | Time in seconds to retain a registry scan job before deleting.                        | 604800    |
| `crowdstrikeConfig.jobTypeConfigs.tagScrape.jobRetentionMax`            |         | Time in seconds to retain a repository scan / tag scrape job before deleting.         | 604800    |
| `crowdstrikeConfig.jobTypeConfigs.tagAssessment.jobRetentionMax`        |         | Time in seconds to retain a completed tag assessment job before deleting.             | 604800    |


### Configure temporary storage

The self-hosted registry scanner pulls and decompresses each image it scans to traverse through layers, image configs, and manifests. 
To do this, it needs some scratch disk space. 

The size of this storage is important because if you provide too little storage it can be a significant bottleneck for processing images.
**The minimum recommended size for this mount is 3x the size of your largest compressed image.**
Larger volume mounts allow for image scanning concurrency and faster results.

The self-hosted scanner is forced to skip images that are too large to copy, unpack, and assess in the allocated storage space.

You have 3 options for SHRA's temporary data storage:
* A new Persistent Volume Claim, created during deployment
* You provide an existing storage claim name
* A new temp emptyDir, created during deployment

Persistent Volume Claim is the default storage type and is recommended if your storage provider supports dynamic creation of storage volumes. 

> [!IMPORTANT]  
> At deployment, SHRA will try to create a Persistent Volume Claim. 
> However, since each Kubernetes installation uses different storage classes, SHRA cannot offer a default storage class that works universally. 
> **Your deployment will fail unless you configure the storage class type, specify `local` for an emptyDir, or specify the name of an existing storage claim.**

To use an existing storage claim, set `executor.assessmentStorage.pvc.create` to `false` and configure `executor.assessmentStorage.pvc.existingClaimName` with your storage class name.

To have a new emptyDir created, set `executor.assessmentStorage.type` to `local` and if your deployment needs more than the default 100 gibibytes of storage, set the emptyDir size in `executor.assessmentStorage.size`. 

To have a new persistent volume claim created, configure `executor.assessmentStorage.pvc.storageClass` with a value from the table of storage class options for SHRA's supported runtimes in [Configure persistent data storage](#configure-persistent-data-storage).
If your deployment needs more than the default 100 gibibytes of storage, set the PVC size in `executor.assessmentStorage.size`. 

Configure your temporary storage location by editing the following lines to your `values_override.yaml` file. 

| Parameter                                           |             |Description                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               | Default           |

#### Storage driver considerations when sharing a PVC for assessment storage

If you are running multiple executor pods, and your storageClass supports it, the executor pods can share a single volume for unpacking images. 

By default, the `executor.assessmentStorage.pvc.accessModes` field is set to `ReadWriteOnce`, as this mode is supported by all storage drivers. However, this setting prohibits sharing of a single database volume across pods. 

To share a single volume for image unpacking across your executor pods:

1. Confirm that your storageClass supports the `ReadWriteMany` mode.
2. Set  `executor.assessmentStorage.pvc.accessModes` to `ReadWriteMany`. 


### Configure SHRA scaling to meet your scanning needs

We've tailored our Helm chart with performant default values to suit the majority of situations.
However, you can still scale your cluster to handle more throughput by adjusting the number of Executor Pods running.

Each Executor Pod can inventory approximately 100 images per hour, assuming an average image size of 1 GB. 

To increase or decrease the number of Executor Pods, edit the `executor.replicaCount` values in your `values_override.yaml` file. 

| Parameter                    |             |Description                                                                                                                  | Default     |
|:-----------------------------|------------:|:----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|:------------|
| `executor.replicaCount`      |             | The number of Executor Pods. This value can be increased for greater concurrency if CPU is the bottleneck.                  | 1           |

### Allow traffic to CrowdStrike servers

SHRA requires internet access to your assigned CrowdStrike authenication API and upload servers. 
If your network requires it, configure your allow lists with your assigned CrowdStrike cloud servers.

### Optional. Configure CrowdStrike allow list

By default, API access to your CrowdStrike account is not limited by IP address. 
However, we offer the option to restrict access by IP addresses or ranges to ensure your account is only accessed from specific networks.

Note that if your account is already IP address restricted, requests from other IPs (including the one where you're deploying SHRA) will be denied access and result in the error `HTTP 403 "Access denied, authorization failed"`.

To protect your account, or add your SHRA IP details to the CrowdStrike allow list for your CID, see [IP Allowlist Management](https://falcon.crowdstrike.com/documentation/page/a80757b1/ip-allowlist-management).

### Optional. Configure gRPC over TLS

The Job Controller and Executor Pods communicate with one another over gRPC. 
If you wish, you can configure TLS for communication between these Pods with either [cert-manager](https://cert-manager.io/) or your own certificate files. 

To enable TLS (regardless of the option you choose) add the following line to your `values_override.yaml` file, then follow the steps below.

| Parameter                                   | | Description                                                                                                                             | Default     |
|:--------------------------------------------|-|:----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|:------------|
| `tls.enable`                                | | Set to `true` to enforce TLS communication between the Executor Pods and job-controller as they communicate job information over gRPC.  | false       |

See [full `values.yaml` configuration options](#falcon-chart-configuration-options) for complete TLS configuration.

#### Option 1. Enable gRPC TLS with Cert Manager

Cert-manager is a native Kubernetes certificate management controller. 
It can help automate certificate management in cloud-native environments.

Add the Jetstack Helm repository:

```sh
helm repo add jetstack https://charts.jetstack.io --force-update
```
Install cert-manager with Helm:

```sh
helm install \
  cert-manager jetstack/cert-manager \
  --namespace cert-manager \
  --create-namespace \
  --version v1.15.2 \
  --set crds.enabled=true
```

Add the following line to your `values_override.yaml` file.

| Parameter                                 |   | Description                                                                                                                         | Default     |
|:------------------------------------------|---|:------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|:------------| 
| `tls.useCertManager`                      |   | When `tls.enable` is set to true, this field determines if cert manager should be used to create and control certificates.          | true        |

#### Option 2. Enable gRPC TLS with custom secret

If you have an existing certificate as a Kubernetes secret you wish to use for these Pods, provide them as the `tls.existingSecret`.

| Parameter                                 |   | Description                                                                                                    | Default     |
|:------------------------------------------|---|:---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|:------------|
| `tls.existingSecret`                      |   | Specify an existing Kubernetes secret instead of cert manager.                                                 | ""          |

#### Option 3. Enable gRPC TLS with custom certificate files

If you have existing certificate files you wish to use for these Pods, provide them as the `tls.issuer`.

| Parameter                                 |   | Description                                                                                                    | Default     |
|:------------------------------------------|---|:---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|:------------|
| `tls.issuer`                              |   | Reference to an existing cert manager Issuer or ClusterIssuer, used for creating the TLS certificates.         | {}          |

### Optional. Configure HTTP Proxy

If needed, you can route HTTP traffic through a proxy for your registry connections and/or CrowdStrike connections.

There are 2 options for configuring HTTP proxy:
* with static proxy values
* with Kubernetes secretes or configmaps

#### Option 1. Set static proxy values

There are three environment variables you can set for the executor by configuring `proxyConfig` in your `values_override.yaml` file:

| Parameter                                 |   | Description                                                                                                   | Default     |
|:------------------------------------------|---|:--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|:------------|
| `proxyConfig.HTTP_PROXY`                  |   | Proxy URL for HTTP requests unless overridden by NO_PROXY.                                                    | ""          |
| `proxyConfig.HTTPS_PROXY`                 |   | Proxy URL for HTTPS requests unless overridden by NO_PROXY.                                                   | ""          |
| `proxyConfig.NO_PROXY`                    |   | Hosts to exclude from proxying. Provide as a string of comma-separated values.                                | ""          |

#### Option 2. Set proxy values with Kubernetes secrets or configmaps

You can use existing Kubernetes secrets or configmaps to provide proxy environment variables. This is useful when you want to manage proxy settings separately from the Helm chart deployment.

Your Kubernetes secret must be in the `falcon-self-hosted-registry-assessment` and must have the 1 or more of the following 3 keys:
- HTTP_PROXY (Proxy URL for HTTP requests unless overridden by NO_PROXY.) 
- HTTPS_PROXY (Proxy URL for HTTPS requests unless overridden by NO_PROXY.)
- NO_PROXY (Hosts to exclude from proxying. Provide as a string of comma-separated values.)

You may already have a secret or configmap you want to use. If not, create one.

For example, to create a Kubernetes secret:  

```sh
kubectl create secret generic proxy-config \
   --namespace falcon-self-hosted-registry-assessment \
   --from-literal=HTTP_PROXY="http://proxy.example.com:8080" \
   --from-literal=HTTPS_PROXY="http://proxy.example.com:8080" \
   --from-literal=NO_PROXY="localhost,127.0.0.1,.svc.cluster.local"
```

To use a Kubernetes secret, add the following references to the `executor` and `jobController` sections of your `values_override.yaml file`. Update `name` to match the name of your secret.

   ```yaml
   executor:
     additionalSecretEnvFrom:
       - name: "proxy-config"
         optional: false

   jobController:
     additionalSecretEnvFrom:
       - name: "proxy-config"
         optional: false
   ```

To use a Kubernetes configmap, add the following references to the `executor` and `jobController` sections of your `values_override.yaml` file . Update name to match the name of your configmap.
   ```yaml
   executor:
     additionalCMEnvFrom:
       - name: "proxy-config"
         optional: false

   jobController:
     additionalCMEnvFrom:
       - name: "proxy-config"
         optional: false
   ```

Use the `optional` field to specify whether the pods should start if the secret is missing:

The `optional` field determines whether the pods will start if the secret is missing:
- **`optional: false`** (default) - Pods will fail to start if the secret doesn't exist
- **`optional: true`** - Pods will start even if the secret is missing

After completing the remaining steps to configure and install SHRA, return here to verify that the environment variables are properly configured in the pod's environment:

```sh
kubectl exec -n falcon-self-hosted-registry-assessment <pod-name> -- env | grep -i proxy
```

## Forward SHRA Container Logs to LogScale

[Falcon LogScale](https://www.crowdstrike.com/platform/next-gen-siem/falcon-logscale/) is part of CrowdStrike's Next-Gen SIEM for central log management. 
The LogScale Kubernetes Collector can be deployed in the SHRA namespace within Kubernetes for forwarding log messages from the applications used in registry assessment. 

By forwarding logs from the SHRA up to LogScale, you can more easily monitor and alert on the health of your registry assessments. 

Setting up this log collector is optional, but highly recommended. 
The best time to set up the log collector is before you deploy the Helm Chart.
Your SHRA container logs are important diagnostic and troubleshooting tools.

> [!NOTE]
> The SHRA logs collected through LogScale count towards your daily third-party data ingestion limit. 
> To optimize data collection and avoid exceeding this limit, you can adjust SHRA's default logging level. See instructions below. 
> For more details on managing your data ingestion and understanding limits,  see About Falcon Next-Gen SIEM.

Configure LogScale by completing the following tasks:
* Optional. Set the SHRA default log levels
* Create the HEC Ingest Connector
* Start the Kubernetes LogScale Collector in your SHRA namespace
* Review logs in the UI
* Configure saved searches to monitor SHRA

> [!NOTE]  
> If you need assistance with SHRA deployment or ongoing activity with your self-hosted registry scans, CrowdStrike will request that you add the log collector to your installation.

### Configure SHRA log levels

SHRA logs at the info level (3) by default. You can adjust this to optimize your data collection:
* Error (1): Captures critical issues only
* Warning (2): Includes errors and potential problems
* Info (3): Adds general operational information
* Debug (4): Provides detailed diagnostic data

Each level includes all previous levels. For example, level 2 captures both warning and error logs.

In your `values_override.yaml` file, set `executor.logLevel` and `jobController.logLevel` to your chosen log levels. 
We recommend warn level (2) for both executor and job controller. 
```yaml
executor:
  logLevel: 2
jobController:
  logLevel: 2
```

| Parameter                  |   | Description                                                                                                   | Default     |
|:---------------------------|---|:--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|:------------|
| `executor.logLevel`        |   | Log level for the executor service (1:error, 2:warning, 3:info, 4:debug).                                                    | ""          |
| `jobController.logLevel`   |   | Log level for the job controller service (1:error, 2:warning, 3:info, 4:debug).                                                  | ""          |


### Create the HEC Ingest Connector

The Kubernetes Collector sends logs over HTTP.
Therefore, the first step is to create a Data Connector in the Falcon console, configured to accept HTTP Event Connector (HEC) source logs. 
Perform the following steps to set up your Data Collector. 
If neeeded, see our complete documentation on [setup and configuration of the HEC Data Connector](https://falcon.crowdstrike.com/documentation/page/bdded008/hec-http-event-connector-guide). 

1. In the Falcon console go to go to [**Next-Gen SIEM** > **Data sources**](https://falcon.crowdstrike.com/data-connectors/).
2. Select **HEC / HTTP Event Connector**.
3. On the **Add new connector** page, fill the following fields:
   * **Data details**:
     * **Data source**: `<Provide a name such as Self-hosted Registry Assessment Containers>`
     * **Data type**: `JSON`
   * **Connector details**:
     * **Connector name**: `<Provide a name such as SHRA Log Connector>`
     * **Description**: `<Provide a description such as Logs to use for monitoring and alerts>`
   * **Parser details**: `json (Generic Source)`
4. Agree to the terms for third party data sources and click **Save**.
5. When the connector is created and ready to receive data, a message box appears at the top of the screen. 
Click **Generate API key**. 
6. From the **Connection setup** dialog, copy the **API key** and **API URL** to a password management or secret management service. 

   Modify the API URL by removing `/services/collector` from the end. Your value will look like: `https://123abc.ingest.us-1.crowdstrike.com` where the first subdomain (`123abc` in this example) is specific to your connector.

> [!IMPORTANT]  
> The API Key will not be presented again, so don't close the dialog until you have it safely saved. 

7. Export these variables for use in later steps:
   ```sh
   export LOGSCALE_URL=<your-logscale-api-url without /services/collector>
   export LOGSCALE_KEY=<your-logscale-key>
   ```

### Start the Kubernetes LogScale Collector in your SHRA namespace

LogScale provides a [Kubernetes Log Collector](https://library.humio.com/falcon-logscale-collector/log-collector-kubernetes-helm-config.html) that can be configured with Helm. 

1. Create a secret for your LogScale API key within Kubernetes.
   ```sh
   kubectl create secret generic logscale-collector-token \
         --from-literal=ingestToken=${LOGSCALE_KEY} \
         --namespace falcon-self-hosted-registry-assessment
   ```

1. Add the LogScale Helm repository.
   ```sh
   helm repo add logscale-collector-helm https://registry.crowdstrike.com/log-collector-us1-prod 
   ```

1. Install the collector in your SHRA namespace. 
   ```sh
   helm install -g logscale-collector-helm/logscale-collector \
         --create-namespace \
         --namespace falcon-self-hosted-registry-assessment \
         --set humioAddress=${LOGSCALE_URL},humioIngestTokenSecretName=logscale-collector-token
   ```

#### Review logs in the UI

The LogScale Collector should now be shipping logs to LogScale within the Falcon console. 

To verify that the Connector is receiving data:
1. From the Falcon console go to go to [**Data connectors** > **My connectors**](https://falcon.crowdstrike.com/data-connectors/connectors).
1. In the list, find the connector you created and check its status. If it's receiving data, the status is **Active**.

To view the logs from this connector:
1. Go to [**Next-Gen SEIM** > **Log management ** > **Advanced event search**](https://falcon.crowdstrike.com/investigate/search?end=&query=kubernetes.namespace%20%3D%20%22falcon-self-hosted-registry-assessment%22&repo=all&start=30m).  
1. Filter by the Kubernetes namespace by adding the following to the query box (adjust if you chose a different namespace)
   `kubernetes.namespace = "falcon-self-hosted-registry-assessment"`. 
1. Keep this window open to monitor for results. Click **Run** once SHRA is installed.

### Configure saved searches to monitor SHRA

Now that your SHRA logs are ingested by LogScale, you can configure scheduled searches to be notified of any issues your SHRA may have in connecting to registries or performing assessment. 

1. Go to [**Next-Gen SEIM** > **Log management ** > **Advanced event search**](https://falcon.crowdstrike.com/investigate/search?end=&query=kubernetes.namespace%20%3D%20%22falcon-self-hosted-registry-assessment%22&repo=all&start=30m).  

1. Modify the query to search for errors. We recommend the following broad search filter:

   ```
   kubernetes.namespace = "falcon-self-hosted-registry-assessment" @source=PlatformEvents @error=true
   ```

1. Follow our NG-SEIM instuctions to [Schedule your search](https://falcon.crowdstrike.com/documentation/page/a4275adf/scheduled-searches-for-edr). You'll be notified when any issues arise that you need to correct regarding registry connections. 


## Install the SHRA Helm Chart

Before you install, follow the configuration steps above to prepare your accounts and create a `values_override.yaml` file with your customizations.

1. Add the CrowdStrike Falcon Helm repository.

   ```sh
   helm repo add crowdstrike https://crowdstrike.github.io/falcon-helm
   ```

1. Update the local Helm repository cache.

   ```sh
   helm repo update
   ```

1. Install the Chart, using your configuration file to specify all the variables.

   ```sh
   helm upgrade --install -f </path/to/values_override.yaml> \
         --create-namespace \
         --namespace falcon-self-hosted-registry-assessment \
         --wait \
         falcon-shra \
         crowdstrike/falcon-self-hosted-registry-assessment
   ```

   For more details, see the [falcon-helm](https://github.com/CrowdStrike/falcon-helm) repository.

1. Verify your installation.

   ```sh
   helm show values crowdstrike/falcon-self-hosted-registry-assessment
   ```

The job controller and executor are now live, and the first registry scans will begin according to your configured cron schedules associated with each registry.
For more information on setting your scanning schedule, see [Configure your scanning schedules](#configure-your-scanning-schedules).

## Update SHRA

As needed, you can change your configuration values or replace the SHRA container images with new releases.

After making changes to your `values_override.yaml` file, use the `helm upgrade` command shown in [Install the SHRA Helm Chart](#install-the-shra-helm-chart).

## Uninstall SHRA

To uninstall, run the following command:
```sh
helm uninstall falcon-shra --namespace falcon-self-hosted-registry-assessment \
      && kubectl delete namespace falcon-self-hosted-registry-assessment
```

## FAQ

### Common scan errors
To configure logging, see [Logs and Logscale Queries](#logs-and-logscale-queries).

#### Context deadline exceeded
The context deadline exceeded error may appear in your SHRA log files.
This error occurs when the job wasn't able to complete in the configured time limit. 

You can increase various timeout values through the Helm Chart to resolve this problem.
Most often, we find the solution is to increase the maximum time for tag assessment. Try adding `crowdstrikeConfig.jobTypeConfigs.tagAssessment.runtimeMax` to your `values_override.yaml` file. 
To see a list of all available configuration options and defaults, see [Falcon Chart configuration options](#falcon-chart-configuration-options).

After you make changes to your `values_override.yaml` file, apply them with `helm upgrade`. For more information, see [Update SHRA](#update-shra).

#### Unable to pull and save image or 400/500 errors
In most cases, this is due to a misconfiguration in the credentials to your registry. This could be as simple as having the wrong url or port. It could be something more complex such as not having proper
permissions for that specific user to connect or pull from the registry. 

Refer to [Configure your CrowdStrike credentials](#configure-your-crowdstrike-credentials-).
If you make any changes you will need to run a `helm upgrade` to apply those changes. Refer to [Update SHRA](#update-shra)

#### Unable to get image inventory
SHRA pulls your images from your registries to the local cluster, then uncompresses them. If there's insufficient disk space to hold both the image and the uncompressed version of that image, an error occurs. 

To overcome this error we need to give the executor more space. This can be done by modifying `executor.assessmentStorage.size`. Refer to [Configure temporary storage](#configure-temporary-storage).
Once that is complete, you will need to run a `helm upgrade` to apply those changes. Refer to [Update SHRA](#update-shra)

#### Validating registry credentials
Some issues around registry scanning stem from incorrect credential scope or permissions. To validate that the credentials can do everything our scanner needs, do the following with the credentials you wish to validate. These tests will require that you have the credentials, a working docker client, and [skopeo](https://github.com/containers/skopeo). If you're unable to complete any of these steps, resolve the issue before moving to the next step.

1. Validate authentication via docker
```sh
docker login -u <registry_username> <registry_url>
```
After entering your password, you should see `Login Succeeded`

2. Validate catalog list via skopeo
```sh
skopeo list-repos --creds=<registry_username>:<registry_password> docker://<registry_url>
```
This should list out all of the repositories that you wish to have scanned. 

3. Validate the repository list via skopeo
```sh
skopeo list-tags --creds=<registry_username>:<registry_password> docker://<registry_url>/<repository_name>
```
This should list out all of the tags that you wish to have scanned.

4. Pull an image via docker 
```sh 
docker pull <registry_url>/<repository_name>:<image_tag>
```
Your client should successfully pull the image

If a repository or tag does not appear in the above outputs, SHRA will not be able to see it. If the client is unable to pull the image, then SHRA will not be able to pull the image.

### How to speed up the process

#### Speed up by increase executors
The work can be parallelized further by adding additional executors. Refer to [Configure SHRA scaling](#configure-shra-scaling-meet-scanning-needs).

#### Speed up by increase amount of catalog requests per page
By default, Docker requests 100 catalog items per page. To get the full list of catalog items, SHRA requests the data one page at a time until there are no more pages.

You can speed this up by increasing the number of items that are requested per page. This can be done by modifying `executor.catalogPerPageRate`. Refer to [Falcon Chart configuration options](#falcon-chart-configuration-options).
If you make any changes you will need to run a `helm upgrade` to apply those changes. Refer to [Update SHRA](#update-shra).

#### Speed up by increasing the size of the persistent claim for assessment
When larger images are present, the number of images that can be worked on at once is limited by the storage size.

To increase the amount of storage size set the persistent volume claim size in `executor.assessmentStorage.size`. Refer to [Configure temporary storage](#configure-temporary-storage).

### Other

#### Download SHRA Executor and Job Controller databases
In cases where it might be helpful to review the database, you can run the following command to download them locally.

Executor Database:
```commandline
kubectl -n <namespace-where-shra-is-installed> cp <pod-name>:/db/ra_executor.db <local path where you want to copy the file to>
```

Job Controller Database:
```commandline
kubectl -n <namespace-where-shra-is-installed> cp <pod-name>:/db/jobcontroller.db <local path where you want to copy the file to>
```
The databases use the SQLite format. Once you're retrieved the files, use a tool with SQLite support to view them.
Each record in the database has an accompanying status value from 0 to 6:

* **0 - Ready:** the job is ready to be started again after a cancellation.
* **1 - Waiting:** work on the job is waiting due to repository constraints, number of executors, or space.
* **2 - In Progress:** assessment is in progress.
* **3 - Done:** the job was processed successfully.
* **4 - Failed:** the job failed. Check the executor log for more details. Often, failures are due to credential issues. Occasionally can be due to problems with an image or other issues.
* **5 - Canceled:** processing was canceled.
* **6 - Waiting for retry:** the job is waiting for resources before retrying.

#### Database space issues
For issues related to either the executor or job controller database running out of space, update the `*.dbStorage.size` settings in your`value_overrides.yaml` file. Refer to [Configure temporary storage](#configure-temporary-storage).

If you make any changes you will need to run a helm upgrade to apply those changes. Refer to [Update SHRA](#update-shra)
