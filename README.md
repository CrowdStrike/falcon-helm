[Falcon](https://www.crowdstrike.com/) isa the [CrowdStrike](https://www.crowdstrike.com/)
platform purpose-built to stop breaches via a unified set of cloud-delivered
technologies that prevent all types of attacks â€” including malware and much
more.

This repository is a collection of CrowdStrike Helm Charts. The Helm Charts developed here are an open source project, not a CrowdStrike product. As such, the project itself carries no formal support, expressed or implied.
